# Mitochondrial Motility Model
This model was created to provide additional validation for experimental work by Catia Silva and Christian Lohmann.
We explored the effects of simulated synaptic activity on a pool of mitochondria with normally distributed stopping times.

Experiments as in the paper can be generated by running `main.py` directly. By default this saves plots in the folder `data/`


## Spike Train Generation
To generate simulated synaptic activity, we used the homogeneous Poisson process function from the [Elephant](https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. 

The function `get_spike_trains` generates a list of times at which a simulated synaptic activity occurs. 
This function takes arguments `num_runs` and `event_hz` which specify how many simulated spike trains to generate, and the frequency of spikes respectively.
If `event_hz` is a list of frequencies, the function will generate spike trains of varying frequency (as specified by the list) with each frequency generated for a fixed block of time (specified by the parameter `freq_block`). 

To visualize the spike trains generated, use the function `plot_spike_trains` specified in `plotting.py`.
